            <h2>Individual Peer Counseling</h2>
            <p>CAPS Individual Peer Counseling (IPC) offers University of Michigan students a supportive space to address mental health needs.<br> 
                Trained in active listening, peer counselors provide a relatable, understanding presence for students to talk to. While IPC offers privacy, it is not a replacement for therapy with a licensed mental health professional at CAPS.</p>
